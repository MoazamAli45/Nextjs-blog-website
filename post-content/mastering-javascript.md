JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'I am Syed Moazam Ali, Frontend Web Developer';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
