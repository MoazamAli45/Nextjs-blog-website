Are you confused about **Git and Github ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”**.

Difference between Git and Github.

âœ…Git is a distributed version control system that records different versions of a file or set of files and lets users access, compare, update, and manage those versions. It is a command-line tool that can be used locally on a developer's computer or on a remote server. Git is used to track changes in source code and collaborate with other developers on a project.

âœ…GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and incorporates Git's version control features so they can be used collaboratively. It is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and share their Git repositories with others. GitHub provides a web interface for managing Git repositories, as well as tools for code review, issue tracking, and project management.
